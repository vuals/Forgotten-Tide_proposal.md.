**Name:** Forgotten tide. This title relates to the main storyline of the game.

**Genre:** Action and adventure, perspective: multi directional, Movement: Jumps, climbing, falling, Conflict: avoidance and survival, Progression: procedural, Aesthetic: cartoonish or realistic. This game will be a story based game and will include all aspects of games like reaction, strategy, puzzle solving, exploration.

**Backstory:** The game will start out with this guy(antagonist) that builds a fake island and he crashes or shoots down a commercial flight and traps these people on his island. The people on the island will not know that this island is fake but will eventually figure it out. The creator of the island has added road blocks or challenges that the players will have to face. He might steal some of the players and trap them in an underground layer of his island. They will have to escape the island safely.

**Characters:** protagonist: James Martin. Antagonist: Malcolm smith

**Market:** Ideal market would be older teenagers and adults but it may have the age range brought down due to graphical limitations.

**Player motivations:** The player keeps playing because of the intriguing storyline that keeps them interested and on edge.

**Selling point:** The main selling point would be the idea of this fake island the player gets trapped on that they need to escape or survive.

**Inspiration:** There is no game wrong dimension. The idea of this game is that the game you are playing is non-existent but the player finds unique and creative ways to play this game and finds out it is a game while a narrator insists there is indeed no game. I would take the concept of the player not knowing there actually is a game and discovering it out throughout the game and translate this to the characters in my game not knowing the island is fake and they will slowly catch on and discover that it is fake.

**Goals:** The player should feel confused and at the start think the island is real but they should be genuinely surprised when they find out that the island is fake.
